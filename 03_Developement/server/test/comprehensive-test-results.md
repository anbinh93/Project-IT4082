## Technical Implementation Details

### Fixed Issues
1. **Authentication**: Corrected admin password from 'admin' to 'admin123'
2. **License Plate Uniqueness**: Implemented timestamp-based generation
3. **Response Data Access**: Fixed path from `response.data.id` to `response.data.data.id`
4. **Household Assignment**: Used available household ID 2 instead of occupied ID 1
5. **Room Consistency**: Used consistent room ID 5 throughout assignment tests

### Database State
- **Households**: 2 total (Nguyễn Văn A, Lê Văn D)
- **Rooms**: 80 total, tested with room 5 (available)
- **Vehicles**: Dynamic count, successfully testing CRUD operations
- **Server**: Running on port 8000, stable throughout testing
