  - Different types and statuses
  - Active/Inactive states

Users: Admin account configured
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123
  - Role: admin
```

---

## 🚀 **Testing Execution Timeline**

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Authentication (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish testing foundation and resolve authentication issues

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **❌ Authentication Failure**
   ```
   Error: Invalid credentials - admin/admin
   ```
   
#### Resolution Process:
1. **Investigation**: Checked createAdmin.js script
2. **Root Cause**: Admin password was 'admin' in test but 'admin123' in database
3. **Fix**: Updated test credentials to match database
4. **Verification**: Successfully authenticated with JWT token

#### Results:
```javascript
✅ Login successful
Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs... (valid JWT)
```

### Phase 2: Vehicle API Testing (45 minutes)
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of vehicle CRUD operations

#### 2.1 GET Operations Testing
```javascript
// Test Results
GET /api/vehicles        ✅ Retrieved 10 vehicles
GET /api/vehicles/types  ✅ Retrieved 5 vehicle types  
GET /api/vehicles/statistics ✅ Retrieved comprehensive stats
```

#### 2.2 CREATE Operation Testing
**Initial Issue**: Duplicate license plate errors
```
Error: "Biển số xe đã tồn tại"
```

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Unique license plate generation
const uniquePlate = `TEST-${Date.now()}`;
```

**Results**:
```javascript
✅ POST vehicle successful
Created vehicle ID: 36 (example)
```

#### 2.3 UPDATE Operation Testing
**Initial Issue**: Response data access errors
```
Error: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```javascript
// Incorrect access pattern
vehicleId = createResponse.data.id; // ❌ Undefined

// Correct access pattern  
vehicleId = createResponse.data.data.id; // ✅ Works
```

**Results**:
```javascript
✅ PUT vehicle successful
Updated vehicle details confirmed
```

#### 2.4 DELETE Operation Testing
```javascript
✅ DELETE vehicle successful
Resource properly removed from database
```

### Phase 3: Room API Testing (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Test room management and assignment workflows

#### 3.1 GET Operations Testing
```javascript
GET /api/rooms           ✅ Retrieved 10 rooms with pagination
GET /api/rooms/statistics ✅ Retrieved detailed statistics
GET /api/rooms/:id       ✅ Retrieved specific room details
```

#### 3.2 Room Assignment Testing
**Multiple Issues Encountered**:

**Issue 1**: Inconsistent Room IDs
```javascript
// Problem: Using different room IDs in same test
assignResponse = await request('POST', '/rooms/2/assign', data);
roomResponse = await request('GET', '/rooms/101'); // ❌ Different room
```

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Use consistent room ID throughout test
const ROOM_ID = 5;
assignResponse = await request('POST', `/rooms/${ROOM_ID}/assign`, data);
roomResponse = await request('GET', `/rooms/${ROOM_ID}`);
```

**Issue 2**: Household Already Assigned
```javascript
Error: "Hộ khẩu đã có phòng" (Household already has room)
```

**Investigation Process**:
1. Checked room assignments via API
2. Found household ID 1 already assigned to room 2
3. Identified available household ID 2 (Lê Văn D)

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Changed from occupied household to available one
const assignData = {
    hokhau_id: 2  // Lê Văn D - available household
};
```

**Issue 3**: Room Availability Validation
```javascript
Error: "Phòng không ở trạng thái trống"
```

**Solution Process**:
1. Queried rooms to find available ones
2. Identified rooms 5, 6, 73 with status "trong"
3. Updated test to use room 5

**Final Results**:
```javascript
✅ POST room assignment successful
Assignment result: {
  success: true,
  message: 'Gán phòng cho hộ khẩu thành công',
  data: {
    id: 5,
    sophong: '105',
    hokhau_id: 2,
    trangthai: 'da_thue',
    hokhau: {
      sohokhau: 2,
      sonha: '456',
      duong: 'Nguyễn Trãi',
      chuHo: { hoten: 'Lê Văn D' }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.3 Room Unassignment Testing
```javascript
✅ POST room unassignment successful
Unassignment result: { 
  success: true, 
  message: 'Hủy thuê phòng thành công' 
}
```

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Validate system robustness and error responses

#### 4.1 Duplicate Data Validation
```javascript
Test: Create vehicle with duplicate license plate
Result: ✅ Correctly rejected with "Biển số xe đã tồn tại"
Status Code: 400 (Bad Request)
```

#### 4.2 Resource State Validation
```javascript
Test: Assign household to occupied room
Result: ✅ Correctly rejected with "Phòng không ở trạng thái trống"
Business Logic: Proper room availability checking
```

#### 4.3 Non-existent Resource Handling
```javascript
Test: Access vehicle ID 99999
Result: ✅ Correctly handled with "Không tìm thấy xe"
Status Code: 404 (Not Found)

Test: Access room ID 99999  
Result: ✅ Correctly handled with "Không tìm thấy phòng"
Status Code: 404 (Not Found)
```

### Phase 5: Performance and Concurrent Testing (15 minutes)
**Objective**: Assess system performance under load

#### Concurrent Request Testing
```javascript
Test: 5 simultaneous API calls
- GET /api/vehicles
- GET /api/rooms  
- GET /api/vehicles/statistics
- GET /api/rooms/statistics
- GET /api/vehicles/types

Result: ✅ All completed in 15ms
Throughput: Excellent performance
No bottlenecks detected
```
